# Image Classification Using Convolution Neural Network
This project is a simple implementation of an image classification probelm where 10000 images are fed to convolutional network.
8000 images are trained on the model and 2000 are tested on the model.
The images contain an image of a cat or dog and its the reponsibility of CNN to learn from the training test and predict images in test set as either a cat image or a dog image. After training and testing our model we create a single prediction of a image.
